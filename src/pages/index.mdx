## Shaz Ravenswood
Hi! I'm a technical leader based in <a href="https://www.discovertasmania.com.au/" target="_blank">lutruwita /  Tasmania</a>, with a keen interest in empowering teams and individuals to do their best work.

Chances are, you've landed here while trying to find my online presence - I'm not active on most social media channels, so do check out my <a href="/thoughts">thoughts</a> and <a href="/bio">bio</a> to find out more about me and my work.

I'm always available for a <a href="https://calendly.com/shaz-r" target="_blank">coffee</a> (virtual or otherwise!) if you're ever in need of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging" target="_blank">rubber duck</a>, or are working on something interesting that you think I might like!
