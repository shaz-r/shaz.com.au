What makes someone a "10x Engineer"?

This question, or something along these lines, tends to pop up every now and then - either from managers looking for their "unicorn" or sometimes even software engineers themselves looking to hone their craft. 

If I may - I'll look at this slightly differently and offer up what makes a good software engineer in a given team:

- Ability to understand and break down a given issue / idea
- Ability to communicate the break down to both technical and non-technical people, so they can understand it too
- Writes simple, clean, very readable code with no crazy bit-shifting magic or shortcuts
- Writes just enough tests to offer confidence in the code
- Writes excellent docs, notes and summaries for all of the above points
- Delivers their work at a *consistent* pace, which is mostly working (bugs are expected and rectified!)
- Gets along well with their colleagues, and always happy to help them succeed
- Raises any concerns, or alarms early
- Understands the "big" picture in terms of both product and people, with the ability to empathise with the restrictions / limitations on and from both

Of course, other folks will have differing requirements of what a "good" or "10x" engineer is to them, but if an engineer with the above qualities is in my team - I'll be doing any and everything to help them, and hope they stick around for a while.
