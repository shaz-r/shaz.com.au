Missatributed at times<sup>([1](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/06/26/define-success/#more-4036),[2](https://wist.info/stanley-bessie-a/28428/))</sup>, but worth reading often: 

> He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often and loved much;  
> who has gained the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;  
> who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;  
> who has left the world better than he found it, whether by an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;  
> who has never lacked appreciation of earth’s beauty or failed to express it; 
> who has always looked for the best in others and given the best he had;  
> whose life was an inspiration;  
> whose memory a benediction.  

> To laugh often and love much;  
> to win the respect of intelligent persons and the affection of children;  
> to earn the approbation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;  
> to appreciate beauty.  
> To find the best in others;  
> to give one’s self;  
> to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition;  
> to have played and laughed with enthusiasm and sung with exaltation;  
> to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived -- this is to have succeeded.
