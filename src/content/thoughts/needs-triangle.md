The work to do, the time to do it in, and the associated cost - three points of what I dub the triangle of needs.

All individuals, teams and organizations will, in one form or another, when setting off to build something, have these three fundamental limits.

There is generally a finite amount of money, which usually limits the amount of resources available over a given time period, plus a looming deadline to be finished by, and hopefully some well thought-out, impactful work to get done.

The earlier these are identified, the limits and restraints of each recognized, the easier it is to have the conversation on *what* can be built, by *when*, and by *who*. 

Once you have the *what*, the *when* and the *who* - the *who* can start figuring out the *where* and *how*.

We assume the *why* has already been answered. If not, that is the first conversation to have - why should we work on this?

The *who*, hopefully empowered, are able to give a more precise *what* they can build by *when*. This is a path, or a rough road to the entirety of the work, in smaller deliverables.

The *what* and *when* should always be up for negotiation and change. Modern engineering teams learn as they build, they'll have hit unexpected roadblocks or have found innovative shortcuts. Ensure their feedback is heard, recognized and incorporated to any roadmaps, timelines and schedules to keep them engaged.

Trust them. Empower them to take risks, make mistakes. Learn from them, and each other.  Ensure that you always get a working piece of work (the chunks of the *what*) at a regular cadence.

Collectively, always be hunting for that sweet spot in the triangle that gets the work delivered, on time, within budget.

The majority of the time, we are restrained on our cost, and/or inflexible with time, and/or the entirety of the work / deliverables is needed.

The triangle will tell you what is being traded. Cost for time and/or deliverables, deliverables for cost and/or time, time for cost and/or deliverables.

Recognize and manage those expectations early, and a positive outcome is nearly always possible.
