A simple question -

> A grad, fresh out of their University / College / School / Bootcamp joins your team. They know the basics of the technology you are using, e.g. React on the Front-End and Go-Lang for your API, or even a full stack RoR application. It's Monday, they've popped up for the first time and have just been given access to their work station, whatever that might be. How long will it take this engineer to commit a change and see it in production? To be more specific, let's say there's a user profile section in your application - they've been tasked with adding a "url" field for users to add a link to their website.

For a reasonably competent engineer, working through a well documented system which emphasizes developer productivity / experience, half a day should be more than enough.

Let's flip this -

> Same scenario as above, but the engineer has been on the team for 12 months. They're now tasked with adding a "github" url/handle field. How long would this take?

90 mins.

These are arbitrary times I think are a good measure - and they include all the relevant requirements; documentation, code, tests, deployment, Q/A, A/B tests etc etc. 

These times are not ones you should aim for, but to start a conversation on where your teams productivity is at the moment and what would be the ideal.
